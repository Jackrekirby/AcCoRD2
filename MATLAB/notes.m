%% To Do List

% Ensure consistent style key value pairs (Word Case)           DONE
% Add functions to class so they can share default args         DONE
% Add collision plotting                                        DONE
% Add json reading                                              DONE
% Set default 3d view                                           DONE
% Add animated paths (2D / 3D)                              (DONE, DONE)
% Add circle surface                                            DONE
% Add cylinders                                                 ....
% Change path colour arguments to cell array                    DONE
% Nested classes                                                ....

% Consider reformatting surface inputs of form (plane, shape)   ....
% Seperate animated path functions into seperate files          DONE
% Consider seperating environment functions into 2d and 3d as   DONE
% highlighting edges would be more useful for 2d while coloured
% faces is more useful for 3d.

% inconsistencies between animated line json importing and shape json
% importing

% switch size to length

% Consider removing path and collision as AnimatedPath makes them redundant
% Points still needed for rendering molecules;
% Using vargin is not longer recommended (find website reference)
